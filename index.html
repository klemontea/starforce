				StarForce is the first resort park which located in space. It was established by Atmosphere
				Company
				in
				2070. Atmosphere Company is an organization under STAR Group which want to expand their business
				into
				entertainment industry. STAR Group, as some of you might have known, is one of the biggest
				player in
				space industry. After 20 years involved in the industry, they decided to expand their business

				which
				AllStar, Waterworld, and Kryptomine. Afterwards, they start developing all necessary
				infrastructure

				branches,
				provides a wide range of space activities for visitors. People will experience this resort park
				in a
				whole new level and they will never find any resorts that could give this magic feeling.
